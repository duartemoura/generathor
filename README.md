# Generathor: LLM-Powered Question-Answer Pair Generator

Generathor is a pipeline designed to leverage large language models (LLMs) for generating high-quality question-answer pairs from textual data. These pairs are used to fine-tune smaller, more efficient LLMs, enabling them to perform better on domain-specific tasks.

## Project Overview

The main objectives of Generathor are:

- Utilize big LLMs like Claude to generate question-answer pairs.
- Fine-tune smaller LLMs with the generated data for improved task-specific performance.
- Streamline dataset preparation for efficient fine-tuning.
